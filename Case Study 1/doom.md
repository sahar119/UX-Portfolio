#  Intervening Doomscrolling

# Synopsis
Doomscrolling, or mindlessly consuming negative content, such as news, has major health consequences for users. As such, understanding the interventions that mitigate the overconsumption of negative content, such as news, is crucial. The project proposes that using emotional-based interventions that expose users to comic or humorous content will help doom scrollers engage less in the consumption of negative news by distracting them and inducing a positive mood in the users. In order to test the proposition, the present project incorporated user insights (both via interviews and surveys) to design and develop an intervention app. An app is a form of distraction recommender system (digital nudging) that can potentially guide users toward healthier digital behaviors and prevent excessive consumption of negative content. 
# Sampling and research procedure
This study explored the role of emotional interventions via a humorous content recommendation system in changing doomscrolling behaviors among young adults under 35. I chose this target group because they are digital natives and have turned to social media and other online news platforms to check the news instead of offline (Galan, Osserman, Parker, & Taylor, 2019). First, an interview and an online survey were used for user research. Second, an analysis was done on the data gained from user research to identify users' problems, emotions, and needs. Third, the prototype’s design and technical implementation were iterated. Several feedback sessions were held between iterations to complement the prototyping procedure. I conducted five one-to-one interviews and workshops with friends.
Additionally, I conducted an online survey with 15 participants. I included several multiple-choice and open-ended questions and asked them to answer similar questions as those offline users (5 friends). The figure below illustrates a summary of the sample and the procedure.

# User Research
## Friendship group procedure
  A semi-structured interview was conducted with a total of fifteen questions developed by the researcher. Participants were selected through the convenience sampling method, in which the researcher selects participants because this is the easiest way for them to access it (Nickolopoulou, 2022). This method was chosen because of the limited time frame of the project, so a friendship group of the researcher’s known friends or acquaintances was used to facilitate open and natural conversations. The criteria for the participants were: (1) to be between 18 and 35 years of age; (2) to have sufficient English language proficiency; (3) to have doomscrolling experience on online news platforms; or (4) to have excessive social media consumption.
The procedure was divided into two parts:
- 75-minute one-on-one interviews with 5 participants.
- A 60-minute collaborative workshop where participants were asked to explain their opinions about the two types of comics.

## Online recruited group procedure
To prevent potential biases in the user research sampling and gain as many diverse insights as possible, I collected data from 15 participants via an online survey using the same friendship group criteria and questions.
The table below illustrates the demographics of the online recruited groups.

# Analysis of User Research Data
The affinity map demonstrates the core insights from both groups of users (face-to-face interviews and online participants). More specifically, I summarized the participants' answers for each category of questions: main intention or motivation to scroll, feelings during scrolling, hacks, and their needs or reasons for having an intervention app that can interrupt their mindless scrolling habits. The analysis has been done to identify the main users’ problems and find key insights from the user research to apply in the prototype design process. Most participants had experienced negative feelings while scrolling through negative news or content on the Internet, leading them to become even more engaged while scrolling through negative content.

Overall, the user research provided important insights about users' intentions in scrolling online negative content, such as news, and the emotions of users during scrolling. Such insights are important, as they were critical to being considered in the prototyping process to design and develop an app that could benefit users with doomscrolling problems. The table below shows the emotional response toward doomscrolling analysis.

# Prototyping
An intervention nudging The app was developed based on insights from the theoretical review and user research analysis. The prototype consists of the design part and technical code components. In the design part, three different interventions were designed based on emotion, meditation, and notification. Moreover, an app customization part was designed that consisted of different parts such as setting app limitations, setting downtime schedules, adding and customizing interventions, and an overview of reports. 
# First Iteration
The prototype creation process began with designing three different interventions to investigate different effects on target users, with ideas extracted from insights from the theoretical framework and analysis from user research.
