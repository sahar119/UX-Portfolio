# Synopsis
Doomscrolling, or mindlessly consuming negative content, such as news, has major health consequences for users. As such, understanding the interventions that mitigate the overconsumption of negative content, such as news, is crucial. The project proposes that using emotional-based interventions that expose users to comic or humorous content will help doom scrollers engage less in the consumption of negative news by distracting them and inducing a positive mood in the users. In order to test the proposition, the present project incorporated user insights (both via interviews and surveys) to design and develop an intervention app. An app is a form of distraction recommender system (digital nudging) that can potentially guide users toward healthier digital behaviors and prevent excessive consumption of negative content. 
# Sampling and research procedure
This study explored the role of emotional interventions via a humorous content recommendation system in changing doomscrolling behaviors among young adults under 35. I chose this target group because they are digital natives and have turned to social media and other online news platforms to check the news instead of offline (Galan, Osserman, Parker, & Taylor, 2019). First, an interview and an online survey were used for user research. Second, an analysis was done on the data gained from user research to identify users' problems, emotions, and needs. Third, the prototype’s design and technical implementation were iterated. Several feedback sessions were held between iterations to complement the prototyping procedure. I conducted five one-to-one interviews and workshops with friends.
Additionally, I conducted an online survey with 15 participants. I included several multiple-choice and open-ended questions and asked them to answer similar questions as those offline users (5 friends). The figure below illustrates a summary of the sample and the procedure.
