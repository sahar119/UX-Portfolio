# Synopsis
Doomscrolling, or mindlessly consuming negative content, such as news, has major health consequences for users. As such, understanding the interventions that mitigate the overconsumption of negative content, such as news, is crucial. The project proposes that using emotional-based interventions that expose users to comic or humorous content will help doom scrollers engage less in the consumption of negative news by distracting them and inducing a positive mood in the users. In order to test the proposition, the present project incorporated user insights (both via interviews and surveys) to design and develop an intervention app. An app is a form of distraction recommender system (digital nudging) that can potentially guide users toward healthier digital behaviors and prevent excessive consumption of negative content.Â
