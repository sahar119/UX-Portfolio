# Enhancing Viewersâ€™ Liking of Abstract Art via Adding Information about the Content of a Painting
![header](/Assets/Garden.jpg)
## Synopsis
I focused on exploring the possibilities to help viewers of modern (abstract) paintings understand and, as such, like modern art. In this project, I chose pictures of five abstract paintings from the Liden Museum (Museum De Lakenhal) based on the current theory. I ran a controlled experiment with 100 users, during which I found that for abstract paintings with very abstract titles, adding a short story about the content of the painting will significantly increase perceived fluency and understanding of modern art and, as such, increase liking. I suggested how the insights from this research can be incorporated as a new feature into the Museum App for painting viewers.
