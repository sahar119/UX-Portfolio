# Enhancing Viewers’ Liking of Abstract Art via Adding Information about the Content of a Painting
![header](/Assets/Garden.jpg)
## Synopsis
### I focused on exploring the possibilities to help viewers of modern (abstract) paintings understand and, as such, like modern art. In this project, I chose pictures of five abstract paintings from the Liden Museum (Museum De Lakenhal) based on the current theory. I ran a controlled experiment with 100 users, during which I found that for abstract paintings with very abstract titles, adding a short story about the content of the painting will significantly increase perceived fluency and understanding of modern art and, as such, increase liking. I suggested how the insights from this research can be incorporated as a new feature into the Museum App for painting viewers.

## Background
People's motivations for visiting museums vary. Some visit museums to entertain themselves, some like to learn about the past or get inspired, and some like to feel connected. Feeling connected has been suggested as an important motivation for museum visitors. Such feelings of connectedness, in turn, increase viewers’ appreciation and liking of art. However, not all museum visitors may appreciate all types of art, such as modern art. One reason is that viewers find it hard to process contemporary art's meanings cognitively. Because modern art does not represent the real world and includes abstract concepts, it requires a greater need for interpretation than classic art. In abstract paintings, the artist nearly omits the content, leaving it up to the viewers to interpret and extract meaning from the painting. Furthermore, understanding the meaning of modern abstract artwork is not finished by just looking at what is depicted, for instance, in an abstract artwork.
## Research question
How can museums help viewers of modern art understand the meanings and, as a result, increase the viewers’ liking of modern art and improve the visiting experience?
## Method
Based on the literature, it seems plausible to predict that by adding some additional information about the content of an abstract painting, viewers will experience less difficulty processing and extracting the meaning. Accordingly, increased perceived fluency leads to increased appreciation or liking of abstract painting. The following figure illustrates the theoretical framework and proposed relationships.

I adopted a quantitative research method. I ran an experiment to test the key prediction in the present study. Running an experiment and manipulating the independent variable allowed me to explore whether adding information about the content enhances perceived fluency and liking more than adding only the title or nothing. I developed a survey including all the measures and manipulations of the independent variable. In the experiment, I created three conditions (title and brief description, title only, no title, no description). Participants were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions.

In the control condition, participants only received information about the name of the artist and the year the painting was created. In the title condition, in addition to the name of the artist and year of painting, participants received information about the title of the paintings. In the main study condition or description condition, in addition to the name, year, and title, participants received a brief description of the paintings' content. To choose the paintings for the study, I went to the De Lakenhal Museum in Leiden and took pictures of 10 modern paintings that were abstract. I chose five paintings that seemed more abstract than the rest and decided to include them in the experimental study.

For the descriptions, I collected the descriptions of paintings as shown next to them in the De Lakenhal Museum. I kept the information related to the content and removed additional information, such as the painting technique or information about the artists' friends. After seeing the paintings, I asked them to respond to questions measuring perceived fluency, liking, tolerance for ambiguity, prior museum visits, and knowledge of modern art (whether they had visited a modern art museum in the past). In addition, I also measured the perceived abstractness of the painting and whether they would recommend the museum to a friend or family member. In the end, they responded to demographic questions.
## Findings
To analyze the data, I used SPSS. I examined the correlation between the study variables. The correlation between adding more information to the painting and perceived fluency was positive but small (r = .34, p <.001). Perceived fluency was significantly and positively correlated with liking (r = .43, p <.001) and the likelihood of recommending the museum (r = .50, p <.001). Finally, there was a significant positive but small correlation between prior knowledge (those who visited a modern art museum in the past) and perceived fluency, suggesting that prior knowledge increases perceived fluency (r = .24, p =.015). Low tolerance for ambiguity was negatively and positively correlated with perceived fluency (r =- .27, p <.01), suggesting that people with a lower tolerance for ambiguity perceived the abstract paintings as less fluent. There was no significant correlation between the perceived abstractness of the paintings and the study condition, suggesting that participants perceived the paintings as equally abstract in all three study conditions. In sum, the results from correlation analysis provide some initial evidence that additional information about the content of abstract paintings may benefit viewers as it can enhance perceived fluency and liking.

As an additional analysis, I divided the data into two parts based on prior knowledge (have you visited a modern museum in the past? 1= No, 2= Yes), and I looked at the means for perceived fluency, liking, and recommending the museum to a friend or family. I controlled for tolerance for ambiguity and art museum frequency visits. Figures 2, 3, and 4 illustrate the mean values. The results showed that adding descriptions did not change the perception of fluency for viewers with no prior knowledge of modern art.

## Discussion
The present study aimed to explore whether adding additional information about the abstract art content enhanced perceived fluency and liking of the painting. The results showed that adding a brief description to an abstract painting is more beneficial for viewers knowledgeable about modern art. In line with fluency-liking theory, knowledgeable viewers liked the paintings with more information about the content, as adding the information enhanced the perceived fluency of the meanings or content. However, it is important to note that adding a description did not significantly increase perceived fluency compared to adding only a title. One reason could be that the title of the paintings I have used was already noticeably clear and conveyed the meanings of the content in the paintings. As such, even without descriptions, viewers could understand the content and process it easily. Future research may replicate the results I found in the present study by including abstract paintings with abstract titles or titles that do not directly convey the meaning of the paintings. This way, it would be possible to examine whether adding descriptions to the painting with a highly abstract title enhances perceived fluency and liking. Surprisingly, adding descriptions did not enhance novices’ perceived fluency in abstract paintings. Understanding why novices and knowledgeable viewers respond differently to adding more information to abstract paintings can be an interesting area for future research.

Despite interesting results, my study has several limitations. I used a limited number of paintings, and I did not pilot test my paintings to see if there was any variation in the level of novelty and abstractness between the paintings. Some paintings I used, such as Sphere, might have been perceived as more abstract than Flemish Carnival. Another limitation was I did not measure the feelings of being connected to the painting. Despite these limitations, my study has important implications for the museums that exhibit modern abstract paintings, such as the De Lakenhal Museum. Based on the results, it is possible to integrate a new functionality in the current Lakenhal App. Specifically, it would be beneficial to add an option to the App: “a short story about this painting,” such that those viewers who find the title unclear enough to process the meaning of the paintings could choose this option and read more information. By reading the story about the abstract painting, viewers will be able to process the painting easily and understand the meaning of the painting, like it more, and feel more connected. Furthermore, with this new option in the app, visitors can read these stories and information on their mobile phones with the appropriate font size and preferred language instead of standing and finding these stories on the information label on the wall, avoiding blocking others' visits.
