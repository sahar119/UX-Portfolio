# Enhancing Museum Visitors`s Experience with AI: Designing a chatbot for Nemo museum
![header](/Assets/example03.png)
## Synopsis
Visitors to museums encounter a lot of exhibits on a variety of subjects but can explore only a small number of them due to the limited time of their visit (Minkov et al., 2017). Furthermore, getting lost in a museum is easy, which may influence visitors' experiences (Rubino et al., 2013). Having these problems, visiting museums for parents with pre-teen children is even harder. A chatbot can address both issues above by recommending exhibitions and directions and providing visitors with an enhanced visiting experience. 
For this project, I have chosen the NEMO Science Museum, the fifth most visited museum in the Netherlands and offers many activities and exhibits (Cattani et al., 2017) for a wide range of user age groups. I focused on how to improve the guidance aspect of the user experience during visits to the NEMO Museum Amsterdam for parents with pre-teen (9–12-year-old) children. In this project diary, I will give an overview of my insights, which are guidance during the visit and feedback after visiting the NEMO, visitors' experiences based on semi-structured interviews with the museum`s visitors and staff, and how I iterated over the design based on user feedback, which resulted in designing a chatbot.
## Problem
How can we improve the guidance aspect of the user experience during visits to the NEMO Museum Amsterdam for parents with pre-teen (9–12 year old) children via the museum app? 
## Design Process
Empathize => Define => Ideate => Prototype => Test
## Empathize
### Semi-structured interview
I wanted to familiarize myself with the Nemo visitor's experience and their pain points. Therefore, I conducted semi-structured interviews, asking six participants (five parents of pre-teen children and one staff member) about their visiting experience.
### Interview Visitors Nemo questions

### Interview Nemo staff

### Findings
- 40% of the participants found navigation through exhibitions and floors to be neither easy nor difficult. However, when the museum is crowded, it is hard to handle their kids. 
- Some participants stated that the guidance provided by the apparatus and workshops was insufficient. There is no age definition or information about safe activities for kids.
- 53% of the participants needed more adaptive information about live workshops and exhibitions.
- Only 1 of the 6 participants believed there was no need to have an app for the museum.
### User Persona
Based on the interview findings, I've created a user persona to represent the user target of the project. Who are they? What are they interested in? By doing this, I can empathize with the target users more closely and better interpret their expectations, concerns, and motivations.

## Define
### Storyboard 
Using the insights from the survey and user persona, I created a storyboard to illustrate a museum's visitor's pain points.

### Problem Statement
I identified a few problem statements based on the findings.

## Ideate
The idea was to design a chatbot for the museum`s app. Therefore, users can follow it everywhere in the museum and get directions, maps, information, and guidance; furthermore, the chatbot gives feedback on their visit experience.
## Prototype
### Iteration1

### Test and feedback session
### Iteration2
### Clickable Prototype
