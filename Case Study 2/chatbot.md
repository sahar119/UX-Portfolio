# Enhancing Museum Visitors`s Experience with AI: Designing a chatbot for Nemo museum
![header](/Assets/example03.png)
## Synopsis
Visitors to museums encounter a lot of exhibits on a variety of subjects but can explore only a small number of them due to the limited time of their visit (Minkov et al., 2017). Furthermore, in a museum, it is easy to get lost, which may influence visitors' experiences (Rubino et al., 2013). A chatbot can address both of the aforementioned issues by recommending exhibitions and directions and providing visitors with an enhanced visiting experience. In this project diary, I will give an overview of my insights (which are guidance during the visit and feedback after visiting the NEMO) and visitors' experiences based on semi-structured interviews with NEMO visitors.
