# Enhancing Museum Visitors`s Experience with AI: Designing a chatbot for Nemo museum
![header](/Assets/example03.png)
## Synopsis
Visitors to museums encounter a lot of exhibits on a variety of subjects but can explore only a small number of them due to the limited time of their visit (Minkov et al., 2017). Furthermore, in a museum, it is easy to get lost, which may influence visitors' experiences (Rubino et al., 2013). Having these problems, visiting museums for parents with pre-teen children is even harder. A chatbot can address both of the aforementioned issues by recommending exhibitions and directions and providing visitors with an enhanced visiting experience. 
For this project, I have chosen the NEMO Science Museum, which is the fifth most visited museum in the Netherlands and offers many activities and exhibits (Cattani et al., 2017) for a wide range of user age groups. I focused on how to improve the guidance aspect of the user experience during visits to the NEMO Museum Amsterdam for parents with pre-teen (9–12-year-old) children. In this project diary, I will give an overview of my insights, which are guidance during the visit and feedback after visiting the NEMO, visitors' experiences based on semi-structured interviews with the visitors and the workers of the museum, and how I iterated over the design based on user feedback, which resulted in designing a chatbot.
