# Enhancing Museum Visitors`s Experience with AI: Designing a chatbot for Nemo museum
![header](/Assets/example03.png)
## Synopsis
Visitors to museums encounter a lot of exhibits on a variety of subjects but can explore only a small number of them due to the limited time of their visit (Minkov et al., 2017). Furthermore, in a museum, it is easy to get lost, which may influence visitors' experiences (Rubino et al., 2013). Having these problems, visiting museums for parents with pre-teen children is even harder. A chatbot can address both issues above by recommending exhibitions and directions and providing visitors with an enhanced visiting experience. 
For this project, I have chosen the NEMO Science Museum, which is the fifth most visited museum in the Netherlands and offers many activities and exhibits (Cattani et al., 2017) for a wide range of user age groups. I focused on how to improve the guidance aspect of the user experience during visits to the NEMO Museum Amsterdam for parents with pre-teen (9–12-year-old) children. In this project diary, I will give an overview of my insights, which are guidance during the visit and feedback after visiting the NEMO, visitors' experiences based on semi-structured interviews with the museum`s visitors and staff, and how I iterated over the design based on user feedback, which resulted in designing a chatbot.
## Problem
how to Improve the guidance aspect of the user experience during visits to the NEMO Museum Amsterdam for parents with Pre-teen (9-12 years) children? 
## Design Process
Empathize => Define problem state => Ideate => Prototype => Test=> Iteration=> Test=> Final prototype
## Empathize
### First visit to the museum 
I gained some insights from observation on the first visit, I wanted to familiarize myself with the Nemo visitor's experience and their pain points.

### Semi-structured interview
I conducted semi-structured interviews, asking 6 participants (five parents of pre-teen children and one staff member) about their visiting experience.
