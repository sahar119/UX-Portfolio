# Enhancing Museum Visitors`s Experience with AI: Designing a chatbot for Nemo museum
![header](/Assets/example03.png)
## Synopsis
Visitors to museums encounter a lot of exhibits on a variety of subjects but can explore only a small number of them due to the limited time of their visit (Minkov et al., 2017). Furthermore, getting lost in a museum is easy, which may influence visitors' experiences (Rubino et al., 2013). Having these problems, visiting museums for parents with pre-teen children is even harder. A chatbot can address both issues above by recommending exhibitions and directions and providing visitors with an enhanced visiting experience. 
For this project, I have chosen the NEMO Science Museum, the fifth most visited museum in the Netherlands and offers many activities and exhibits (Cattani et al., 2017) for a wide range of user age groups. I focused on how to improve the guidance aspect of the user experience during visits to the NEMO Museum Amsterdam for parents with pre-teen (9–12-year-old) children. In this project diary, I will give an overview of my insights, which are guidance during the visit and feedback after visiting the NEMO, visitors' experiences based on semi-structured interviews with the museum`s visitors and staff, and how I iterated over the design based on user feedback, which resulted in designing a chatbot.
## Problem
How can we improve the guidance aspect of the user experience during visits to the NEMO Museum Amsterdam for parents with pre-teen (9–12 year old) children via the museum app? 
## Design Process
Empathize => Define => Ideate => Prototype => Test
## Empathize
### Semi-structured interview
I wanted to familiarize myself with the Nemo visitor's experience and their pain points. Therefore, I conducted semi-structured interviews, asking six participants (five parents of pre-teen children and one staff member) about their visiting experience.
### Interview Visitors Nemo questions

### Interview Nemo staff

### Findings
- 40% of the participants found navigation through exhibitions and floors to be neither easy nor difficult. However, when the museum is crowded, it is hard to handle their kids. 
- Some participants stated that the guidance provided by the apparatus and workshops was insufficient. There is no age definition or information about safe activities for kids.
- 53% of the participants needed more adaptive information about live workshops and exhibitions.
- Only 1 of the 6 participants believed there was no need to have an app for the museum.
### User Persona
Based on the interview findings, I've created a user persona to represent the user target of the project. Who are they? What are they interested in? By doing this, I can empathize with the target users more closely and better interpret their expectations, concerns, and motivations.

## Define
### Storyboard 
Using the insights from the survey and user persona, I created a storyboard to illustrate a museum's visitor's pain points.

### Problem Statement
I identified a few problem statements based on the findings.

## Ideate
I generated a few How Might We statements in response to address the above problem statements.

## Prototype
With a clear understanding of our users's pain points, I began brainstorming solutions. The main idea was to design a chatbot for the museum`s app. Therefore, users can follow it everywhere in the museum and get directions, maps, information, and guidance; furthermore, the chatbot gives feedback on their visit experience.

### Test 
I asked users (a total of 6 people) to run my app and navigate through the prototype based on an imaginary scenario in which they are parents with their children visiting NEMO at the weekend while the museum is crowded and noisy.
Here are my user testing results: 
User A
- Show the number of floors of exhibitions (because it’s confusing for people to find).
User B
- Show the distance of staff to visitors (by this, people will choose the nearest staff to them, for instance, 500 m).
- Change the color of your template from black to a brighter color.
User C
- Suggest WCs and food catering (because it’s a vital need specifically for children). 
User D
- In the communication between the mother and staff, when a mother asks, do you think it is safe for my daughter to work with chemical material? staff replied, Yes, for sure. It seems deceiving and needs more explanation to prove why the staff is sure about the safety of the laboratory. For instance, it is safe because our laboratory staff always checks the devices in the lab before the museum's working hours, and all experiments are designed with the lowest level of risk for children.
UserE
- Change the conversation between the visitor and the staff into a conversation between the visitor and the chatbot.

### Clickable Prototype
## Conclusion
Considering the potential of the NEMO museum as an interactive science museum, for fulfillment to reach an ideal chatbot, there is still a need for more ideas, iterations, tests, and research to integrate more aspects into a museum mobile app.
